# mathematics
Eitherway I am preparing for an examination. so I thought of understanding each bit and on the way kinda hopes it will make it a bit of intresting.

## Matrix

### Representation

Thr matrix must be represented with a 2D array. for the effective representation the different data structures are looked at.
 * 2D array of Integers
 * List of Lists
 * matrix (numpy)

#### Numpy
Installation
```
pip install numpy
```
to use in your project or program (python) you have to import this specific library

```
import numpy
```
I'll try at first using the default functions and slowly will try to implement them by root level. with custom written functions


trying first commit.
